Our project involves creating a PONG game for two players, where the movements of each player's paddle are controlled via a camera that captures their hand movements. The game will detect whether a player raises their right hand (moving the paddle right) or left hand (moving the paddle left). This real-time interaction will be implemented using Python, leveraging the PyGame library for the game mechanics and the CV2 library for image processing.
